## Agent-Environment Interface

### Agent
An agent is a computer system that is situated in some environment, and that is capable of autonomous action in this environment in order to meet its design objectives.

## Environment
**The surroundings or circumstances in which an AI system functions** are referred to as the environment in AI. It includes the physical environment, digital platforms, and virtualized worlds where AI models and algorithms are used

## State
A state in AI is a representation of the current situation or environment that the AI system is in. This can be thought of as the ==snapshot== of the current situation that the AI system is trying to make sense of. In order to make decisions, the AI system needs to be able to understand the current state of the world around it.

### Perception Subsystem
The perception subsystem ==processes data from sensors into structured information.==This information can then be used for path planning or control. 
### Probabilistic Reasoning
Probabilistic reasoning is a way of representing knowledge that uses probability to indicate uncertainty. Part of the job also involves correcting for reflexive behavior. It stitches together a sequence of events.
### Logical Reasoning
