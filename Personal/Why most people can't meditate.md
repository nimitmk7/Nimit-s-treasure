Meditation doesn't help you concentrate. Concentration leads to meditation. You can't meditate if you can't concentrate.

Your whole day is a preparation. Your rituals throughout the day is what supports you. You can't meditate for 5 mins a day and then practice distraction the whole day, its not a life that supports meditation.

People are running into everything(be it the gym, yoga class) and then running out.
