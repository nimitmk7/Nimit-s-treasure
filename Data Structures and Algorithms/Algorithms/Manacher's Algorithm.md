If we need to calculate Longest Palindromic Substring at each 2*N+1 positions from left to right, then palindromeâ€™s symmetric property could help to avoid some of the unnecessary computations (i.e. character comparison). If there is a palindrome of some length L centered at any position P, then we may not need to compare all characters in left and right side at position P+1. We already calculated LPS at positions before P and they can help to avoid some of the comparisons after position P.
