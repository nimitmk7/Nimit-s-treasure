Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

### Example

**Step 1**: Initially stack and visited arrays are empty.

**Step 2:** Visit 0 and put its adjacent nodes which are not visited yet into the stack.

**Step 3**: Now, Node 1 at the top of the stack, so visit node 1 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

**Step 4:** Now,Â Node 2 at the top of the stack, so visit node 2 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited (i.e, 3, 4) in the stack.

**Step 5:** Now, Node 4 at the top of the stack, so visit node 4 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

**Step 6:** Now, Node 3 at the top of the stack, so visit node 3 and pop it from the stack and put all of its adjacent nodes which are not visited in the stack.

Now, Stack becomes empty, which means we have visited all the nodes and our DFS traversal ends.

## Complexity analysis

**Time Complexity**: O(V + E)
**Space Complexity**: O(V) for recursive implementation
