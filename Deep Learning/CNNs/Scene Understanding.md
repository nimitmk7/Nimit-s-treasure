## Introduction
Understanding of a scene in a meaningful way is considered to be one of the core and strenuous problems in computer vision. 

Scene is not simple, rather complex having multiple objects which may belong to different classes or belong to similar class, and all these objects will have a relation with each other. 

Scene understanding deals with not only detecting the objects but also locating the position, orientation, relation with other objects, their actions like human gesture, and the event they represent.
