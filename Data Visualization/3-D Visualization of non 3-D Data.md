- Data that are not intrinsically 3D-related. 
	- No variables that are directly related to x, y and z.
	- E.g. stock price, house price, votes, population, etc.

## Example 1

### What works ?
- Orthographic projection.
- Extensive labeling.
- Great rendering.
- Occlusion is not severe due to the usage of log scale

Interactive version: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/03/19/upshot/3d-yield-curve-economic-growth.html

### What works ?
- Interactivity
- Multiple selected views
- In-chart explanation
- Grid lines

### Example 3

Guided tour of 21 years of the Nasdaq

VR version: https://graphics.wsj.com/3d-nasdaq/

### What works ?
- Novel Viewing Experience(VR)
- Draw from Familiar experience(Stairs)
- Well annotated

## What makes 3D work ?
- Clever usage of the 3rd dimension
- Show multiple carefully chosen views
- Use orthographic project if possible
- Avoid using area or volume as visual channel
- Allow interactive rotation to get around occlusion
- Provide rich annotation
