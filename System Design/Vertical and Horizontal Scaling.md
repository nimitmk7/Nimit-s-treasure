## Vertical Scaling
It is the process of adding more power(CPU, RAM, etc.) to your servers. Also referred to as “Scale up”.

## Horizontal Scaling
It is the process of adding more servers to the resource pool. Also referred to as “Scale out”.

## Vertical vs Horizontal

When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option, and the simplicity of vertical scaling is its main advantage. Unfortunately, it comes with serious limitations.
- Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server.
- Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely.

Horizontal scaling is more desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling.
