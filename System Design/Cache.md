A cache is a temporary storage area that stores the result of expensive responses or frequently accessed data in memory so that subsequent requests are served more quickly.

### Cache tier
The cache tier is a temporary data store layer, much faster than the database.
### Benefits
1. Better system performance
2. Reduced database workload
