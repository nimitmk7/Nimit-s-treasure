A Poisson random variable gives the probability of a given number of events in a fixed interval of time (or space). It makes the Poisson assumption that events occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event.

## Formulation

**Notation**: $X \sim Poi(\lambda)$
**Description**: Number of events in a fixed time frame if (a) the events occur with a constant mean rate and (b) they occur independently of time since last event.
**Parameters**: $\lambda \in \{0,1,\dots \}$, the constant average rate
**Support**: $x \in \{0,1,\dots \}$
**PMF equation**: $$P(X=x) = \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}$$
**Expectation**: $E[X] = \lambda$
**Variance**: $\text{Var}(X) = \lambda$
