Structured data follows a predefined data model, also known as a data schema. The predefined structure makes your data easier to analyze.  

The disadvantage of structured data is that you have to commit your data to a predefined schema. If your schema changes, you’ll have to retrospectively update all your data, often causing mysterious bugs in the process.

Because business requirements change over time, committing to a predefined data schema can become too restricting. Or you might have data from multiple data sources that are beyond your control, and it’s impossible to make them follow the same schema.

This is where unstructured data becomes appealing. Unstructured data doesn’t adhere to a predefined data schema. Even though unstructured data doesn’t adhere to a schema, it might still contain intrinsic patterns that help you extract structures.

Unstructured data also allows for more flexible storage options. 

A repository for storing structured data is called a data warehouse. Data warehouses are used to store data that has been processed into formats ready to be used.

A repository for storing unstructured data is called a data lake. Data lakes are usually used to store raw data before processing.
