## What is a TIFF ?

A TIFF, which stands for Tag Image File Format, is a computer file used to store raster graphics and image information. A favorite among photographers, TIFFs are a handy way to store high-quality images before editing if you want to avoid lossy file formats.

TIFF files:

- Have either a .tiff or .tif extension.
- Are a lossless form of file compression, which means they’re larger than most but don’t lose image quality.

TIFFs aren’t the smallest files around, but they enable a user to tag up extra image information and data, such as additional layers.

### TIFF to GeoTIFF
GeoTIFF is based on the TIFF format and is used as an interchange format for georeferenced raster imagery. GeoTIFF is in wide use in NASA Earth science data systems. 

It is a [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain "Public domain") [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_(computing) "Metadata (computing)") standard which allows [georeferencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeference "Georeference") information to be embedded within a [TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF "TIFF") file. The potential additional information includes [map projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection "Map projection"), [coordinate systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system "Coordinate system"), [ellipsoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsoid "Ellipsoid"), [datums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_(geodesy) "Datum (geodesy)"), and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file. The GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with TIFF 6.0, so software incapable of reading and interpreting the specialized metadata will still be able to open a GeoTIFF format file.
