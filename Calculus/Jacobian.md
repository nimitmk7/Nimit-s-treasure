The Jacobian of a function $z = f(x)$ is the matrix of its first-order partial derivatives. 

$$
J = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial z_{1}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial z_{1}}{\partial x_{n}} \\ \ddots & \vdots  \\ \frac{\partial z_{m}}{\partial x_{1}} & \cdots & \frac{\partial z_{m}}{\partial x_{n}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
