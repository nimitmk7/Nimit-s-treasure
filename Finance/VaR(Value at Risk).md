## Definition

**Value at risk (VaR)** is a statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame.

VaR modeling determines the potential for loss in the entity being assessed and the probability that the defined loss will occur. One measures VaR by assessing:
1. the amount of potential loss
2. the probability of occurrence for the amount of loss(Confidence_)
3. The time frame.

A financial firm may determine an asset has a 3% one-month VaR of 2%, representing a 3% chance of the asset declining in value by 2% during the one-month time frame. The conversion of the 3% chance of occurrence to a daily ratio places the odds of a 2% loss at one day per month.($30\times 0.03 = 1$)
## Example

### Assumptions:
1. Time period = 1 year
2. Confidence interval = 95%
3. $\mu = 1$%, $\sigma = 1$%, $z = 1.65$

### Formula

$$VaR = \mu - z \cdot \sigma$$
$VaR = -0.65$%
