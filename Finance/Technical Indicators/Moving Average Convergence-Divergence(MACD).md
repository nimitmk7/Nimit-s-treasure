Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a technical indicator to help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify market entry points for buying or selling. 

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is a ==trend-following momentum indicator== that shows the ==relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a securityâ€™s price==.

## Formula
$$MACD = \text{12-Period EMA} - \text{26-Period EMA}$$

The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.
