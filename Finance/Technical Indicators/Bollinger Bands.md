## Components
1. Middle Band: Usually a 20-period simple moving average (SMA).
2. Upper Band: Middle Band + (2 * standard deviation of price)
3. Lower Band: Middle Band - (2 * standard deviation of price)

## Interpretation
1. **Volatility**: The ==width of the bands indicates market volatility==. Wider bands suggest higher volatility, while narrower bands indicate lower volatility.
2. Trend: The direction of the middle band can indicate the overall trend.
3. Potential reversals: Prices tend to return to the middle band, so extreme moves to the upper or lower bands might signal potential reversals.
