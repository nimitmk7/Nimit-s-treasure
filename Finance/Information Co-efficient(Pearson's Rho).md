The Information Coefficient is the (Pearson) correlation between the return on a common stock predicted by a valuation model or analyst and the actual return. 

$$
\rho = \frac {1}{(n-1)} \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(\frac{X_i-\bar X_i}{s_X})(\frac{Y_i-\bar Y_i}{s_Y})
$$ where
$s_X, s_Y$ are standard deviations of X and Y

## Limitations
1. It works only with continuous variables,
2. It only accounts for a linear relationship between variables.
3. It is sensitive to outliers.
