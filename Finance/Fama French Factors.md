 8. ST_rev, standing for "short term reversal" --this is a mean reversion factor
 9. RF standing for "risk free rate.“

- These features are called risk factors. Fama and French theorize that these risk factors represent different risks that investors take, in return for a premium or profit.
- So according to Fama and French, each risk factor is associated with a "risk premium.” Each "risk premium" measures how much profit the investor gets in return for a unit of risk invested in that factor.
- Fama and French developed a regression model called the Fama-Macbeth model to calculate the "**risk premium**" associated with each Fama-French feature.

## SMB
SMB (Small Minus Big) is the average return on the three small portfolios minus the average return on the three big portfolios,

 SMB = 1/3 (Small Value + Small Neutral + Small Growth) - 1/3 (Big Value + Big Neutral + Big Growth)

## HML
HML (High Minus Low) is the average return on the two value portfolios minus the average return on the two growth portfolios, 
 	  HML = 1/2 (Small Value + Big Value)- 1/2 (Small Growth + Big Growth).	 

## $R_m - R_f$ 
 $R_m - R_f$ , the excess return on the market, value-weight return of all CRSP firms incorporated in the US and listed on the NYSE, AMEX, or NASDAQ that have a CRSP share code of 10 or 11 at the beginning of month t, good shares and price data at the beginning of t, and good return data for t minus the one-month Treasury bill rate
