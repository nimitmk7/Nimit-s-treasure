## Introduction
 The capital asset pricing model is a model used to determine a theoretically appropriate required rate of return of an asset, to make decisions about adding assets to a well-diversified portfolio.

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) describes the relationship between [systematic risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/systematicrisk.asp), or the general perils of investing, and [expected return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expectedreturn.asp) for assets, particularly stocks.1

 It is a finance model that establishes a linear relationship between the required return on an investment and risk. The model is based on the relationship between an asset's [beta](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp), the [risk-free rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) (typically the [Treasury bill](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) rate), and the [equity risk premium](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/061815/what-difference-between-market-risk-premium-and-equity-risk-premium.asp), or the expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate

## Formulation

$$
ER_{i} = R_{f} + \beta_{i} (ER_{m} - R_{f}) 
$$
where

$ER_i$ = expected return on investment
$R_f$ = risk free rate
$\beta_i$ = beta of the investment
($ER_m$ - $R_f$) = market risk premium

Investors expect to be compensated for risk and the [time value of money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timevalueofmoney.asp). The [risk-free rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-freerate.asp) in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for the investor taking on additional risk.
