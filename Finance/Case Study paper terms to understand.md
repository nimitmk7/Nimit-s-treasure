2. Realized Variance

6. Copula Functions

## Imp points

**Objective**: Generate the future multivariate probability distribution, with N assets one day ahead, using a new methodology that combines supervised machine learning regression algorithms, realized volatility and copula functions.

With the simulated scenarios we propose to allocate the weights of the portfolio based on an optimisation model.
