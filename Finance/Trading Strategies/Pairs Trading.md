## What is a pairs trade ?
A pairs trade is a trading strategy that involves **matching a long position with a short position** in ==two stocks with a high correlation==.

## Background
Pairs trading was first introduced in the mid-1980s by a group of technical analyst researchers that were employed by Morgan Stanley, the multinational investment bank and financial services company. The pairs trade strategy uses statistical and technical analysis to seek out potential market-neutral profits.

[[Market-neutral]] strategies are a key aspect of a pairs trade transaction. Market-neutral strategies involve long and short positions in two different securities with a positive correlation. The two offsetting positions form the basis for a hedging strategy that seeks to benefit from either a positive or negative trend.
