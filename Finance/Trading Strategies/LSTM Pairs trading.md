Most financial price series are not stationary or mean-reverting. But, fortunately, we are not confined to trading those "prefabricated" financial price series:

We can proactively create a portfolio of individual price series so that the market value (or price) series of this portfolio is mean reverting or "stationary."

Let us call a portfolio with a stationary price history(or alternatively with a stationary return history) a "stationary portfolio."

If we can find a stationary linear combination of several non-stationary price series, then these price series are called **co-integrated**.

A stationary portfolio is constructed from co-integrated assets, using dynamic weights that guarantee that the portfolio price will mean revert.
