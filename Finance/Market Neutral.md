A market-neutral strategy is a type of investment strategy undertaken by an investor or an [investment manager](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-manager.asp) that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets while attempting to completely avoid some specific form of market risk.

Market-neutral strategies are often attained by taking matching long and short positions in different stocks to increase the return from making good stock selections and decreasing the return from broad market movements.
