## Definition
Alpha measures the amount that the investment has returned in comparison to the market index or other broad benchmark that it is compared against. 

The alpha figure for a stock is represented as a single number, like 3 or -5. However, the number actually indicates the percentage above or below a benchmark index that the stock or fund price achieved. In this case, the stock or fund did 3% better and 5% worse, respectively, than the index.

> [!WARNING] 
> Alpha is a historical number. It's useful to track a stock's alpha over time to see how it did, but it can't tell you how it will do tomorrow.

## Simple Example
Portfolio A's annualized return was 18.1%, while the S&P 500's annualized return was 16.4%. So portfolio A's alpha in comparison with  S&P 500 is 1.7%.

## Intuition
Â It describes an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its "edge."
