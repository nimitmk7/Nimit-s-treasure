## What is a bond ?

A **bond** is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to **provide cash flow to the creditor** (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).

## Characterisitics of a Bond

### Coupon Rate
It is the rate of interest the bond issuer will pay on the face value of the bond, expressed as a percentage. 

For example, a 5% coupon rate means that bondholders will receive 5% x $1,000 face value = $50 every year.

### Face Value/Par Value
A bond's face value is ==the amount of money an issuer promises to pay to a bondholder when the bond matures==. It's also known as the par value or redemption value. 

For example, say an investor purchases a bond at a premium of $1,090, and another investor buys the same bond later when it is trading at a discount for $980. When the bond matures, both investors will receive the $1,000 face value of the bond.

### Coupon Dates
**Coupon dates** are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. Payments can be made in any interval, but the standard is semiannual payments

### Maturity Date
**The maturity date** is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bondholder the face value of the bond.

### Issue Price
**The issue price** is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bond.  In many cases, bonds are issued **at par**.


## Yield-to-Maturity(YTM)
The yield-to-maturity (YTM) of a bond is another way of considering a bond’s price. YTM is the **total return anticipated on a bond** if the bond is **held until the end of its lifetime**.

YTM is considered a long-term bond yield but is **expressed as an annual rate**. In other words, it is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled.
