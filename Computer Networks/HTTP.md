Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is ==a set of rules for transferring files over the internet==. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. HTTP is designed to transfer information between networked devices, and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack.
