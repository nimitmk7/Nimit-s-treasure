If an ML system is built for a business, it must be driven by business objectives, which will need to be translated into ML objectives to guide the development of ML models.

We’ll consider the four requirements: reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. We will then introduce the iterative process for designing systems to meet those requirements.

Before using ML algorithms to solve your problem, you first need to frame your problem into a task that ML can solve.

## Business and ML Objectives

Most companies don’t care about the fancy ML metrics. They don’t care about increasing a model’s accuracy from 94% to 94.2% unless it moves some business metrics. 

A pattern I see in many short-lived ML projects is that the data scientists become too focused on hacking ML metrics without paying attention to business metrics.

The ultimate goal of any project within a business is, therefore, to increase profits, either directly or indirectly. For an ML project to succeed within a business organization, it’s crucial to tie the performance of an ML system to the overall business performance.

The effect of an ML project on business objectives can be hard to reason about.
For example, an ML model that gives customers more personalized solutions can make them happier, which makes them spend more money on your services. The same ML model can also solve their problems faster, which makes them spend less money on your services.

To gain a definite answer on the question of how ML metrics influence business metrics, experiments are often needed. Many companies do that with experiments like A/B testing and choose the model that leads to better business metrics, regardless of whether this model has better ML metrics.

When evaluating ML solutions through the business lens, it’s important to be realistic about the expected returns. Due to all the hype surrounding ML, generated both by the media and by practitioners with a vested interest in ML adoption, some companies might have the notion that ML can magically transform their businesses overnight.
Magically: possible. Overnight: no.

Returns on investment in ML depend a lot on the maturity stage of adoption. The longer you’ve adopted ML, the more efficient your pipeline will run, the faster your development cycle will be, the less engineering time you’ll need, and the lower your cloud bills will be, which all lead to higher returns
