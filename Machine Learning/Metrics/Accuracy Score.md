$$
Accuracy = \frac {\text{True Positives}+\text{True Negatives}}{\text{True Positives+ True Negatives+False Positives+False Negatives}}
$$

It is the fraction of examples correctly classified. 

## Disadvantages
1. It works well as a scoring function for comparing models only if the number of questions requiring ‘yes’ for an answer roughly equals the number of requiring ‘no’ for an answer. (==Doesn't work well for imbalanced category distribution==)
