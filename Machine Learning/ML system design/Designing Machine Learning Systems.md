Generic ML Questions:

"What model should I use ?"
"How often should I retrain my model?”
“How can I detect data distribution shifts?” 
“How do I ensure that the features used during training are consistent with the features used during inference?”

Specific ML Questions:

"I’m convinced that switching from batch prediction to online prediction will give our model a performance boost, but how do I convince my manager to let me do so?”  
“I’m the most senior data scientist at my company and I’ve recently been tasked with setting up our first machine learning platform; where do I start?”

ML systems are both complex and unique. 

They are complex because they consist of many different components (ML algorithms, data, business logic, evaluation metrics, underlying infrastructure, etc.) and involve many different stakeholders (data scientists, ML engineers, business leaders, users, even society at large). 

ML systems are unique because they are data dependent, and data varies wildly from one use case to the next.
