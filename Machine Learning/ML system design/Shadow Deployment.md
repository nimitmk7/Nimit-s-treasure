We deploy the new model in parallel with the existing model. Each incoming request is routed to both models, but only the existing modelâ€™s prediction is served to the user.

This minimizes the risk of unreliable predictions until the newly developed model has been thoroughly tested. 

But, it is a costly approach as it doubles the number of predictions.
