## Goal
We want to discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data. 

The only requirement to be called an unsupervised learning strategy is to learn a new feature space that captures the characteristics of the original space while maximizing some objective function or minimizing a loss function.

## Methods

### Clustering
**Goal**: Group data together based on their similarities.

> [!INFO] NOTE
> Clustering is a special form of dimensionality reduction, where the cluster labels themselves can be used as a new feature.

### Dimensionality Reduction
