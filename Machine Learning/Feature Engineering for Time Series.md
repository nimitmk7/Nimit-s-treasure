## Goal
The goal of feature engineering is to provide strong and ideally simple relationships between new input features and the output feature for the supervised learning algorithm to model.

## Types of Features

1. Date-time features
2. Lag features
3. Rolling Window features


## Rolling Window features
Rolling window features are a summary of values over a fixed window of prior time steps.

### Momentum features
### Volatility features
Volatility is simply the annualized standard deviation of the stock returns. 
### Reversion to the mean features


## Other features(a.k.a "factors")

#### Technical Indicators(heuristics)
 ##### Relative Strength Index(RSI)
 ##### Moving Average Convergence Divergence

#### Statistical Indicators
Statistical indicators are features engineered using price information too, but the formulas are based on statistical models, such as:
- Principal Component Analysis
- Co-integration Analysis

#### Fundamental(Accounting/Economy based) indicators
Unlike technical indicators, fundamental indicators are based on: micro-economics (that is, accounting) or on macro-economics.

The most well known fundamental indicators are the style factors, closely related to the Fama-French Factors.

- Growth, Value, Quality
- Commitment of Traders Contract numbers
- Credit Cycle/Economic Leading indicators
	- Bond Spreads, PMI, Dow Jones Transportation Index

#### Sentiment Indicators
- VIX, Put-call parity spread
