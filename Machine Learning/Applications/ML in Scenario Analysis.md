Scenario planning/[[Scenario Analysis]] is a necessity for any Finance department’s analysis of the forecast in today’s business landscape. By leveraging insights driven by artificial intelligence (AI), Finance can increase the speed, accuracy and time to value in the scenario planning process. AI and machine learning (ML) can also help uncover not only important trends and drivers, but also internal and external pressures that can impact the forecast and help Finance develop scenario plans to address those possibilities. While it isn’t possible to predict the future with 100% accuracy, AI and ML can help Finance better prepare for what’s to come with more effective scenario planning.

## Benefits

1. Enhanced speed and accuracy
	- AI-powered scenario planning automates many manual tasks involved in traditional scenario planning, ultimately reducing the time to generate and share the results. In addition, in today’s digital economy, companies have access to more data than ever. AI can process this evergrowing data and consider additional business intuition — such as events, pricing, competitive information and weather — to produce more accurate scenario predictions.
2. Improved Risk Management
	- AI can incorporate substantially more drivers, both internal and external, to automatically identify correlations, patterns and anomalies across thousands of products and locations, which can then be used to make better-informed decisions on managing risk and preparing for potential scenarios.
	- Now, planners can focus more on leveraging the potential scenarios rather than producing them
3. Better cross-functional collaboration
	- Machine learning has the capability to forecast at very granular and frequent levels to support processes such as demand planning and S&OP processes where planning by product and/ or region is required. Such forecasting can, with ML, be done on a daily or weekly basis. These processes drive cross-collaboration between operational and financial scenario planning. In essence, effective scenario planning looks across the organization for various scenarios that might impact financials, negatively or positively, and that process requires cross-functional collaboration outside the Finance department and across various lines of business
4. Increased strategic decision-making
	- By analyzing more data more quickly and with better accuracy, analysts can then use their time to take a more comprehensive approach to various possibilities and how they would impact the company’s financial health
	- All leaders want timely and accurate insights to increase performance efficiently and effectively, and AI-powered scenario planning will help leaders do just that.
