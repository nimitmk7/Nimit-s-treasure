## What is LTV ?
Customer lifetime value (LTV) is ==a marketing metric used in e-commerce to estimate the total revenue a business can expect to earn from a customer over the course of their relationship==. LTV is based on a customer's purchase history, frequency, and the length of their relationship with the business.

At e-commerce companies like Spotify or Netflix, LTV is often used to make pricing decisions like setting subscription fees. At marketplace companies like Airbnb, knowing users’ LTVs enable us to: 
1. allocate budget across different marketing channels more efficiently, 
2. calculate more precise bidding prices for online marketing based on keywords, and
3. create better listing segments.
