## Pros/Cons

| Traditional Modeling | ML & DL Models |
| ---- | ---- |
| May require a complex target and input transformation <br>to become linear | Most have Kernels/Transformation functions <br>that can be easily changed from linear to non-linear and vice-versa. |
| Scaling may be required | Scaling maybe required |
| Model selection requires a lot of human input | Model selection requires less human input |
| Model selection involves checking the stationarity <br>of the residualsÂ  that many traditional statistical models require. Correcting any lack of stationarity will be difficult without expertise. | Models such as LSTMs tolerate non-stationarity of the residuals as well.  |
| May require hyper-parameter tuning | May require hyper-parameter tuning |
| Very useful for inferencing causes and effects | Not suitable for inferencing, because input co-efficients are not available or are not as informative as traditional models. |

## Performance

Any model that combines hybrid data, that is structured and non-structured will have to involve deep learning.
