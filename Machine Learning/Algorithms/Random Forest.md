## Use Case
- Random Forest do not work well on high dimensional, sparse data, such as text data. Linear Models are more appropriate for such data.
- Random Forests are well equipped to handle noisy and missing data, and rarely overfit the data.
- They also do not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of your data, and can implicitly handle collinearity in features.
- Random Forests can be used for feature selection because if you fit the algorithm with features that are not useful, the algorithm simply won't use them to split on the data. It's possible to extract the 'best' features.
- High predictive power, one of the best accuracies among all ML models.
