## Introduction
Just as we use a word processor to write documents and deal with words on a computer, we can use a **GIS application** to deal with **spatial information** on a computer. GIS stands for **‘Geographical Information System’**.

## Components
1. **Digital Data** –– the geographical information that you will view and analyse using computer hardware and software.
2. **Computer Hardware** –– computers used for storing data, displaying graphics and processing data.
3. **Computer Software** –– computer programs that run on the computer hardware and allow you to work with digital data. A software program that forms part of the GIS is called a GIS Application.

## Use Cases
1. Open digital maps on your computer.
2. Create new spatial information to add to a map.
3. Create printed maps customized to your needs.
4. Perform spatial analysis.

A common feature of GIS is that they allow you to associate **information**(non-geographical data) with **places**(geographical data). In fact, the GIS Application **can store many pieces of information which are associated with each place** –– something that paper maps are not very good at.

With a GIS Application we have a way to easily change the appearance of the maps we created based on the non-geographical data associated with places.

## Types of Data
1. **Vector Data**: Series of (X,Y) co-ordinates. Used to store points, lines and areas.

2. **Raster Data**: Grid of values. One important difference between raster and vector data is that if you zoom in too much on a raster image, it will start to appear ‘blocky’. In fact these blocks are the individual cells of the data grid that makes up the raster image.
> [!INFO]  In computer graphics and digital photography, a raster graphic represents a two-dimensional picture as a rectangular matrix or grid of pixels, viewable via a computer display, paper, or other display medium.
