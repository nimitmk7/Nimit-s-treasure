## What is Intellectual Property ?

IP is creative works or ideas embodied in a form that can be shared or enable others to recreate, emulate or manufacture them.
### Types of IP

1. Patents
2. Trademarks
3. Copyrights
4. Trade Secrets

USPTO(US Patent and Trademark Office) grants patents and registers trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets do not come under their purview.
## What is a patent?

A U.S. patent gives you, the inventor the right to "exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling" an invention or "importing" it into U.S.

What is granted is not the right to make, use, offer for sale, sell or import the invention, but **the right to stop others from doing so.**

If someone infringes on your patent, you may initiate legal action. U.S. patents are effective only within the U.S. and its territories and possessions.

## Types

1. **Utility Patents**: Inventing a new or improved and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.
2. **Design Patents**: Inventing a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.
3. **Plant Patents**: Inventing or discovering and asexually reproducing any distinct and new variety of plant.

## Validity of Patent

- Utility and Plant Patent: Up to 20 years from filing date
- Design Patent: 15 years from date of grant

You will need to pay maintenance fees on a certain schedule after the utility patent is issued in order to keep it in force. Under certain unusual conditions, patent terms may be extended or adjusted.

## What can be patented ?

For a patent to be issued, the invention must meet four conditions: 

1. Able to be used(the invention must work and cannot just be a theory)
2. A clear description of how to make and use the invention
3. New or, “novel”(something not done before)
4. “Not obvious,” as related to a change to something already invented

Patent law defines the limits of what can be patented. For example, the laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas cannot be patented, nor can only an idea or suggestion. Other restrictions include the patenting of inventions exclusively related to nuclear material or atomic energy in an atomic weapon. 

However, the subject matter that can be protected by patents is vast and varied. For example, even some methods of doing business may be patented.

## Who may apply for a patent?

You (the inventor) or your legal representative may apply for a patent, with some exceptions. These include:
1. The inventor has died.
2. The inventor is legally incapacitated
3. The inventor refuses to apply
4. The inventor cannot be found. 

Two or more people inventing something together may apply for a patent as joint inventors. A person (e.g., a company) to whom an inventor has assigned an invention, or to whom the inventor is obligated (e.g., contractually required) to assign an invention, may also apply for a patent.

If you only contribute money but are not the inventor or co-inventor, you cannot be named as an inventor or co-inventor in the patent application. Furthermore, if you are not the inventor, and the inventor(s) did not assign the invention to you or does not have an obligation to assign the invention to you, you may not apply for a patent. 

USPTO employees cannot apply for or own a patent unless they inherit it.

## What about foreign applicants for U.S. patents?

You may apply for a U.S. patent whether you’re a U.S. citizen or not. No U.S. patent can be issued if, before you apply in the United States, the invention was patented abroad by you or your legal representative and if the foreign application was filed more than 12 months before the U.S. filing. Six months are allowed in the case of designs. Foreign inventors should pay attention to other special requirements.
