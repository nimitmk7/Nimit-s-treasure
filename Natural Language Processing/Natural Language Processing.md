## Premise

Computers are great at working with structured data like spreadsheets and database tables. But us humans usually communicate in words, not in tables. That’s unfortunate for computers.

A lot of information in the world is unstructured — raw text in English or another human language. How can we get a computer to understand unstructured text and extract data from it?

_Natural Language Processing_, or _NLP_, is the sub-field of AI that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages. 

## [[Why is natural language hard ?]]
## Extracting Meaning from Text

The process of reading and understanding English is very complex — and that’s not even considering that English doesn’t follow logical and consistent rules. For example, what does this news headline mean?

> “Environmental regulators grill business owner over illegal coal fires.”

Are the regulators questioning a business owner about burning coal illegally? Or are the regulators literally cooking the business owner? As you can see, parsing English with a computer is going to be complicated.

Doing anything complicated in machine learning usually means _building a pipeline_. The idea is to **break up your problem into very small pieces** and then **use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately**.

Then by **chaining together several machine learning models that feed into each other**, you can do very complicated things.
