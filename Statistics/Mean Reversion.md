If a price series is mean reverting, then the current price level will tell us
something about what the priceâ€™s next move will be: If the price level is
higher than the mean, the next move will be a downward move; if the price
level is lower than the mean, the next move will be an upward move.

The mathematical description of a mean-reverting price series is that the
change of the price series in the next period is proportional to the diff erence
between the mean price and the current price. This gives rise to the ADF
test, which tests whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportionality constant is zero.
