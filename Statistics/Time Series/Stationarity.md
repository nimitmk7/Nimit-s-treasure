## Definition
A sequence of random variables $z = \{z_t\}^{t = \infty}_{t = -\infty}$ is stationary if its distribution is shift invariant to time. 

## Weak Stationarity

## Definition
A sequence of Random variables  $z = \{z_t\}^{t = \infty}_{t = -\infty}$ is weakly stationary if its first 
and second moments are invariant to shifting in time, that is:

1. $E[Z_t]$ is independent of $t$. (Constant mean)
2. $E[Z_t \cdot Z_{t-j}] = f(j)$ for some function $f$. (Co-variance depends on lag $j$)

Therefore, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ should be same for the entire series. If there is no trend but seasonality is present, it qualifies for weak stationarity.
