The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the Pearson Correlation between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.

==Spearman's rho exchanges the Pearson's rho linear relationship for a monotonic relationship, which is more flexible==.

## Formula

$$

$$
$$
\rho = 1 - \frac{6\Sigma d_i^2}{n(n^2-1)}
$$

where
$d_i$ = difference between the 2 ranks of each observation
n = no of observations

## Advantages
1. It is possible to calculate the statistical significance of Spearman's rho by calculating its p-value.
2. It is easy to interpret as it ranges between -1 and 1.
3. It can be used to evaluate linear and non-linear models
