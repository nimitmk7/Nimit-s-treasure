The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables.

To calculate the Pearson correlation, start by determining each variable's standard deviation as well as the [[Covariance]] between them. The correlation coefficient is covariance divided by the product of the two variables' standard deviations.

## Correlation vs Covariance

Covariance measures the direction of a linear relationship between two variables. Correlation measures both the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. 

- Covariance values: Covariance values range from -∞ to +∞.
- Correlation values: Correlation values range from +1 to -1.

Thus, Correlation values are standardized, and therefore more widely used.
