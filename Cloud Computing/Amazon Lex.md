## What is Amazon Lex ?
It is an AWS service for building conversational interfaces for applications using voice and text. 

It provides the deep functionality and flexibility of **natural language understanding** (NLU) and **automatic speech recognition** (ASR) so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike, conversational interactions, and create new categories of products.

To create a bot, you specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex V2 console. 

Amazon Lex V2 manages the dialog and dynamically adjusts the responses in the conversation. 

Using the console, you can build, test, and publish your text or voice chatbot. You can then add the conversational interfaces to bots on mobile devices, web applications, and chat platforms (for example, Facebook Messenger).
